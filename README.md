Mini Hotel Database Management System

This project involved designing and implementing a database to support operations and booking management for a small 16-room mini hotel.

First, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the conceptual data model for the planned system. I defined the key entities required such as rooms, bookings, customers, booking status etc.

I then implemented the model in SQL by creating the tables, keys, relationships between tables and additional constraints. To populate sample data, I imported CSV files into the relevant tables.

Additionally, I wrote several SQL queries to enable various functions for the hotel such as: identifying available rooms, recognizing rooms awaiting housekeeping, calculating average satisfaction scores per room and more.

The project demonstrates the ability to fully design and implement an applied database using SQL from the modeling stage through to writing queries for different business use cases.
